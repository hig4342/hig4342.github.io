This is a raw snippet:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf("Hello World");
	
	return 0;
}
```

Side note comment: applied a bug fix similar to [this commit](https://github.com/Atlas7/atlas7.github.io/commit/6659f4a47f6ec66987adb0f683a9c6f3842252ae#diff-818954a41dbfb01af70050a459c603b9) to ensure code snippet does not collapse unexpectly upon clicking on it. This issue is tracked [here](https://github.com/jarrekk/Jalpc/issues/97).
